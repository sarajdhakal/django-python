# Expense Tracker API 

A small Django REST Framework backend for tracking personal spending
(categories, expenses, date filtering, and a per-category summary).

## Your Task (read this first)

You will work with this codebase in four stages:

1. **Fix 5 bugs.** The code contains **5 intentional bugs**. Find and fix them
   all. Every hint you need is in the codebase or in this file.
2. **Add Authentication (required).** Scope expenses and categories to the
   logged-in user and protect the endpoints.
3. **Build 2 integration features (required):**
   [Currency conversion](#feature-1--currency-conversion) and
   [Budget threshold bot alerts](#feature-2--budget-threshold-bot-alerts).
   Both are specified in detail below, with example requests/responses — these
   are the hard part.
4. **Add 2 optional features** of your choice ([list below](#optional-pick-any-2)).

Config placeholders for stage 3 are already in `.env.example` — copy them into
your `.env`.

Full rules, branch naming, and submission details are in
[requirements](#full-requirements) at the bottom. Read that **before** writing
code — workflow is graded.

## What you've been given

| File / Dir                 | What it is                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `expenses/`                | The app: `models.py`, `serializers.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, `tests.py` |
| `config/`                  | Django project settings and root URL config             |
| `postman_collection.json`  | **Ready-to-import Postman collection — every endpoint.** Use it to test and hunt bugs. |
| `.env.example`             | Template for your `.env`                                 |
| `pyproject.toml`           | Dependencies (managed by `uv`)                          |
| `manage.py`                | Django entry point                                      |

## Setup (3 commands)

Uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Prefix every `manage.py` call with `uv run`.

```bash
uv sync                                  # create .venv + install deps
cp .env.example .env                     # then fill in SECRET_KEY
uv run python manage.py migrate          # set up the SQLite DB
uv run python manage.py runserver        # start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Test the endpoints

1. Import `postman_collection.json` into Postman.
2. The `base_url` variable is preset to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
3. Run each request against your local server. **This is your main bug-hunting
   tool** — compare actual responses against the expected behavior below.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                                                        |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/categories/`       | List all categories                                               |
| POST   | `/api/categories/`       | Create a category                                                 |
| GET    | `/api/expenses/`         | List expenses (filter with `?start_date=` & `?end_date=`, inclusive) |
| POST   | `/api/expenses/`         | Create an expense                                                 |
| GET    | `/api/expenses/{id}/`    | Retrieve one expense                                              |
| PUT    | `/api/expenses/{id}/`    | Update an expense                                                 |
| DELETE | `/api/expenses/{id}/`    | Delete an expense                                                 |
| GET    | `/api/expenses/summary/` | Total spent per category                                          |

## Full Requirements

### Git workflow (graded)

- Create a new repo under **your** GitHub account.
- Default branch **must be named `trunk`** (not `main`/`master`).
- One branch + one PR per item:
  - Bug fixes → `fix/<bug-name>`
  - Features → `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Never commit fixes or features directly to `trunk`.** Merge via PR.
- Do **not** squash. Keep a clean, atomic, readable history. Push regularly.
- Each commit message must say **what** changed and **why**. Example:

  ```text
  fix(expenses): prevent negative expense amounts
  fix(api): correct serializer field mapping
  ```

### Required features

**Authentication** — expenses and categories owned by and scoped to the
authenticated user; endpoints protected (token/session auth + login).

Plus the two integration features below.

#### Feature 1 — Currency conversion

Let expenses be recorded in different currencies and reported in one base
currency, using a third-party exchange-rate API.

- Add a `currency` field to expenses (ISO code, e.g. `EUR`); `amount` stays in
  that currency.
- Reporting endpoints (e.g. `summary`) convert each amount to `BASE_CURRENCY`
  (see `.env.example`) using rates from an exchange-rate API.
- Free providers needing no key: `exchangerate.host`, `open.er-api.com`.

Example (illustrative — refine the exact shape as you see fit):

```jsonc
// POST /api/expenses/
{
  "title": "Hotel in Paris",
  "amount": "120.00",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "category": 1,
  "date": "2026-06-09"
}

// 201 Created
{
  "id": 7,
  "title": "Hotel in Paris",
  "amount": "120.00",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "category": 1,
  "date": "2026-06-09"
}
```

```jsonc
// GET /api/expenses/summary/   (BASE_CURRENCY = USD)
{
  "base_currency": "USD",
  "categories": [
    {
      "category": "Travel",
      "total": "129.60",        // 120.00 EUR converted at 1.08
      "rate": "1.08",
      "as_of": "2026-06-10"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Feature 2 — Budget threshold bot alerts

Send a chat-bot alert when a category's spending crosses a configured limit.

- Add a per-category monthly budget limit.
- When a created/updated expense pushes that category's month-to-date total over
  its limit, send an alert via a bot (Telegram recommended — free token from
  `@BotFather`; Discord/Slack also fine). Credentials come from `.env`
  (`BOT_TOKEN`, `BOT_CHAT_ID`).

Example (illustrative — refine the exact shape as you see fit):

```jsonc
// Set a monthly limit on a category
// POST /api/categories/   (or PATCH an existing one)
{
  "name": "Dining",
  "monthly_limit": "200.00"
}
```

```jsonc
// POST /api/expenses/  — this expense pushes Dining's month total to 215.00,
// over its 200.00 limit, so an alert fires once.
{
  "title": "Dinner out",
  "amount": "45.00",
  "category": 3,
  "date": "2026-06-09"
}

// 201 Created — API responds normally; the alert is sent off the request path.
{
  "id": 12,
  "title": "Dinner out",
  "amount": "45.00",
  "category": 3,
  "date": "2026-06-09"
}
```

```text
Bot message delivered to BOT_CHAT_ID:

⚠️ Budget alert: "Dining" is over its monthly limit.
Spent 215.00 / 200.00 USD for June 2026.
```

Include **screenshots of the delivered bot alert** (the message in your
Telegram/Discord/Slack chat) in your README as proof it works.

#### Optional (pick any 2)

Recurring expenses · CSV export · Analytics dashboard · Expense
search/filtering · Monthly spending summaries · Favorite categories.

Each feature must be fully functional, follow existing API conventions, and
include validation. You may also improve the Django Admin.

### API documentation

- Update `postman_collection.json` with any new endpoints.
- Responses must carry enough data for a frontend to render views without extra
  follow-up requests.

### README write-up

In your README, add two sections:

- `## My Features` — for each feature (auth, currency conversion, bot alerts,
  and your optional one): overview, design decisions, API changes, example
  request/response, assumptions, known limits. For bot alerts, include
  **screenshots of the delivered alert**.
- `## Bugs Found and Fixed` — for each bug: description, root cause, fix, and
  commit hash.

### Submission

Submit: GitHub repo URL · updated Postman collection · updated README
(including bot-alert screenshots).

### Evaluation criteria

Commit quality · bug-fix correctness (no regressions) · feature design ·
Postman completeness · code readability · REST conventions (status codes,
response shape).
